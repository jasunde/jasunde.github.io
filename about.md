After proudly being certified as a software engineer by [Prime Digital Academy](http://primeacademy.io) in 2017, I've happily gotten paid to engineer software since.

I am a learner. I have been a musician and a traveler. I am led by my curiosity for new ideas and new music. I can do much at my own initiative, but I work best with others. I pay attention to what role I can fill to make things work better. I try to listen first, then be clear and compassionate in my communication.
