I'm looking for work as a Full-Stack Software Engineer near Minneapolis, MN.

I recently got certified by [Prime Digital Academy](http://primeacademy.io).

I am a learner.

I have been a musician and a traveler.

I am led by my curiosity for new ideas and new music.

I can do much at my own initiative, but I work best with others.

I pay attention to what role I can fill to make things work better.

I try to listen first, then be clear and compassionate in my communication.

I have an interest in data visualization.
